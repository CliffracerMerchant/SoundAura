        When play in background is turned on, SoundAura must use a regular
        notification to display the player controls (as opposed to a media session
        card). In order to do this, it must have permission to post notifications.
        This is optional, but without permission SoundAura will be unable to display
        a notification containing player controls when play in background is turned
        on.</string>

    <string name="request_phone_state_permission_explanation">
        When not playing audio in the background, your device will let SoundAura
        know that it should pause playback during a call. This will not occur when
        audio is playing in the background. The read phone state permission is
        needed in this case so that SoundAura can detect when a call is ongoing
        and pause playback accordingly.</string>

        This setting will determine how playback will respond to an audio
        device change that results in a volume of zero (e.g. disconnecting
        a headset while the phone\'s speakerphone volume is zero).</string>

    <string name="pause_playback_on_zero_volume_description">
        Playback will automatically resume if another audio device change results
        in a greater than zero media volume (e.g. you reconnect a headset). This
        setting may result in slightly higher battery usage due to the
        app remaining in a paused state in the background.</string>

        This setting will result in the highest battery usage because
